Yo yo

Need new full new line between.
Not this

Like this.

Are you being _sarcastic_? Can use underscores or one set of asterisks. But for clarity, it's a good idea to use one or the other.

So, for instance, Wes uses double-asterisks for bold and underscore for italics. This way, less potential confusion. Or you could use short-cuts. Like command-i for _italics_ with the vs code extension. And command-b for **bold**.

Oh cool. ~~Strikethrough~~ is with double tildas (~~). That's shift-`.
